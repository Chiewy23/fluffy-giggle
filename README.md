# Fluffy-Giggle

This project was taken from an Udemy course titled "The Complete Junior to Senior Web Developer Roadmap".

The basis of the web app is 'RoboFriends', a site whereby Robots are retrieved via an API call and listed on the 
homepage; the robots can also be filtered by name.

This project will mainly be used to upskill, try out new ideas, and experiment with
React generally.

Web app can be accessed via this link - https://chiewy23.github.io/fluffy-giggle/
